# Mingxue ZHANG

## <font color="#4974a5">About Me</font>

I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor at the [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn) in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn). My research interests include **web security** and **software security**. Recently, I have been focusing on 1) investigating security threats on the web and other related applications, e.g., WebView-based mobile apps, and 2) AI-facilitated program analysis and its reliability.

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei). Prior to CUHK, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University (Hongyi Talent Class) in 2018.

I am looking for **self-motivated** Ph.D. and master students who **have strong programming skills**. You may find more information about our application and admission process [HERE](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/csen/2022/0817/c27006a2609353/page.htm).
 
<ins>Please note that our group works on technically challenging problems. I would provide support and help whenever necessary. In the meanwhile, I expect the students to have solid background in computer science, and be willing to learn.</ins> If you are well prepared, feel free to contact me via email.
