## About Me

I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor at the [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn) in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn). My research interests include **web security** and **software security**. Recently, I have been focusing on investigating security threats on the web and other related applications.

I received my Ph.D degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei). Prior to CUHK, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University in 2018.
