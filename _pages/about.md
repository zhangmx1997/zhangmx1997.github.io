## <font color="#4974a5">About Me</font>

I am currently a tenure-track research professor at the [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn) in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn). My research interests include **web security** (e.g., program analysis for scripting languages, abnormal script detection, etc.) and **software security** (e.g., compliance analysis, vulnerability detection, etc.). 

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei). Prior to CUHK, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University (Hongyi Talent Class) in 2018.

## <font color="#4974a5">Recruiment</font>

I am looking for **mentally healthy**, **self-motivated**, and **smart** Ph.D. and master students who **have strong programming skills**. You may find more information about our application and admission process [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iijmFFZaEUYQKaRiIMTrKw).  

ðŸ’¡ Please note that our group works on technically challenging problems. I would provide support and help whenever necessary. In the meanwhile, I expect the students to have **solid background in computer science**, be **willing to learn**, and be **prepared to overcome challenges**. 

ðŸ’¡ Also, we have several application cycles for both Ph.D. and master students, and we welcome undergraduate students who wish to publish at top-tier conferences to join us. However, we only have a few openings each year. Therefore, if you are interested, please contact me via email **as early as possible**.
